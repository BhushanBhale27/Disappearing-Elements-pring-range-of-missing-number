# Disappearing-Elements-pring-range-of-missing-number

Task details

Given an Array (arr) of size n. It only contains elements from range [1,n].

Return an Array of all integers in the range [1,n] that do not appear in the array.



You Have to solve this question without using any extra array.

Hint:- Try using the last approach of rotate arrays Question



Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output: [5,6]

Explanation:- All elements are present from 1 to 8 except 5 and 6.



Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1]

Output: [2]

Explanation:- Elements that should be present is 1,2  (because n is 2 ) but 2 is missing. 





Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= n
